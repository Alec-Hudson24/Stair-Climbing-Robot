# Stair-Climbing Robot

**Compact, rapidly deployable robot capable of smooth rolling on flat surfaces and autonomous stair climbing**  
*(Group project: Mechanical design, rapid fabrication, team coordination)*

## Goal / Overview
- **Primary Requirements**:
  - Assemble/disassemble the entire robot in **under 2 minutes 30 seconds** (quick deployment for inspection or mobility scenarios).
  - Roll smoothly and stably on flat ground (efficient wheeled locomotion).
  - Climb standard stairs from bottom to top and resume smooth rolling at the landing (transition between modes without failure).
- **Motivation**: Create a proof-of-concept for portable robot that could go through uneven and smooth terrain 
- **Outcome**: Fully functional prototype using modular components, quick-release mechanisms for fast assembly, and a hybrid wheel-flipper design that transitions reliably between rolling and stair-climbing modes.

## Programs and Skills Required
- **3D Modeling & Design**: SolidWorks (parametric modeling, assemblies, part drawings, tolerance analysis for manufacturability)
- **Manufacturing & Fabrication**: Water jet cutting, laser cutting, 3D printing, manual machining, assembly techniques
- **Team Collaboration**: Project planning, task division, timeline management, iterative design reviews, group problem-solving
- **Other**: Rapid prototyping, material selection (durability vs. weight), mechanical design principles (gearing, stability, torque requirements)

## Key Takeaways & Lessons Learned
- Modular/quick-release designs drastically reduce assembly time but require precise tolerancing to maintain reliability.
- Early physical prototyping revealed stair-transition challenges that simulations missed — hands-on iteration is essential.
- Clear role assignment and daily check-ins kept the team aligned and prevented last-minute rework.
- Balancing weight, power, and traction is critical for stair-climbing performance without sacrificing flat-ground speed.

  ## Future Improvements / Ideas
- increase reliability and smoothness on flat ground
- Reduce weight with advanced materials (carbon fiber, aluminum alloys)
- Battery-powered drive system with runtime optimization
